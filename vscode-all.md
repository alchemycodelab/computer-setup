#### To validate run this command in your terminal:
 * Note  `Mac` users have an additional step to setting up. You must first finish that step located on [Read me file](README.md), then you can run this command to validate that you have successfully setup `Visual Code Studio`.
```
 code --version
```
#### The exact numbers will probably be different, but as long as you're getting numbers, you can count this as a success!
