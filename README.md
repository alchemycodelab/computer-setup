Computer Setup
-----------------------

Before your first day at Alchemy, you will need to set up your computer. This means that you will need to download and install all the tools necessary for writing code. These guides may contain a lot of terms that you are unfamiliar with. Please do all of the steps thoroughly and to the best of your ability. 

**If you encounter any problems with these guides, please come in a half-hour early to your fist day at Alchemy so that we can help you set up your computer.**

### Setup

##### 1. Ensure that your laptop:

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the most up-to-date, stable version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 2. Sign up for a GitHub account

Head on over to https://github.com/ and sign up. (It's free: there is no cost for a developer account.)
